# SCION Browser Extensions

DEPRECATED!
This version of the browser extension is deprecated and you should migrate to use the officially supported [Browser extension](https://github.com/scionproto-contrib/browser-extension). The new version requires to replace [skip](https://github.com/netsec-ethz/scion-apps/tree/v0.6.0/skip) with the [HTTP Forward proxy](https://github.com/scionproto-contrib/http-proxy). You will find everything you need on the [Browser extension documentation](https://scion-browser-extension.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

As mentioned, [skip](https://github.com/netsec-ethz/scion-apps/tree/v0.6.0/skip) is getting deprecated in benefit of the [HTTP Forward proxy](https://github.com/scionproto-contrib/http-proxy).
